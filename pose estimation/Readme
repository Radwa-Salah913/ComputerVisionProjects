# Hand Sign Recognition Using Mediapipe and Roboflow

This project involves building a computer vision-based system for recognizing hand signs using pose estimation techniques. The problem is framed as a classification 
task, where the goal is to identify hand signs based on their pose landmarks. The project uses Mediapipe for hand landmark detection and Roboflow for sourcing the 
image dataset.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that classifies hand signs into distinct categories using pose estimation data. This involves extracting 
hand landmarks, saving the data for analysis, and applying machine learning algorithms to perform classification.

Source: [Roboflow Hand Signs Dataset]()

## Steps in the Project

Used Mediapipeâ€™s Hands module to detect and extract hand landmarks.

Saved extracted landmarks as coordinate points in a CSV file for further processing.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Applied different machine learning classifiers to the extracted landmark data.

MLP Classifier: Trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy of 70%.

Random Forest Classifier: Trained a Random Forest model, achieving an accuracy of 56%.
